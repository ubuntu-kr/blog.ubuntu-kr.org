      <description>FOSSASIA Summit has been held online in past few years due to COVID-19, but this year, the event has been held in-person finally. I participated in the online event last year as an organizer and worked in the marketing team and the video team. But, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t participate in this year&amp;rsquo;s FOSSASIA event as an organizer. Because when the FOSSASIA team was built this year, I was so busy a few weeks ahead the UbuCon Asia 2022 event in Korea and I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know the team was being created.</description>
